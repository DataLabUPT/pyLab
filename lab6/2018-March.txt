You've just cross-posted this to several Python mailing lists / 
newsgroups, some of them certainly irrelevant. This is not considered 
good form.

What do you mean by "the distribution file"?
How are you creating this file?
How are you "deploying" it?

The server strips out attachments so we cannot
see it, please just paste the (full) text into the

You need to provide us with more specific information

Message-ID: <CAPvEsMx-C0nVM4XS7xL7T_96OszPNUzFJD5-mDH1_4F1O43cUA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to finish chapter 5 in my book and it has to do with
dictionaries and creating simple games. We need a pool of points and the
ability to exchange point between the pool and each of the, what I call,
attributes of Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. I got only to the
first option and I'm stuck on how to get the points to change
"permanently". The program will run well for option 1 (I haven't got to the
rest of the options), but the next time I run the program it goes back to
the original configuration. Did I do everything right, but I just need to
write to a file, and that's what the problem is? or what?

I've reread the chapter, I've gone on stackoverflow and thegeekstuff.com,
I've thought about it for@least a day and I just can't figure out what
the problem is. Please help?

# Character creator program for role playing

pool = 30

attributes = {"Strength": 0, "Health": 0, "Wisdom": 0, "Dexterity": 0}

print("You have", pool, "points")
print("""
    You can apply them to your Strength, Health, Wisdom, or Dexterity.

    Press:

    0 to Quit
    1 to apply points to Strength
    2 to apply points to Health
    3 to apply points to Wisdom
    4 to apply points to Dexterity
    5 to apply points from Strength to your pool
    6 to apply points from Health to your pool
    7 to apply points from Wisdom to your pool
    8 to apply points from Dexterity to your pool
    """)

choice = input("Choice: ")
print(attributes.get("Strength"))

if choice == "0":
    print("Good-bye.")
    input("\n\nPress enter to exit.")

elif choice == "1":
    strengthChoice = input("How many points would you like to transfer from
pool to Strength?: ")
    print(strengthChoice)
    attributes["Strength"] += int(strengthChoice)
    print(attributes.get("Strength"))
    pool -= int(strengthChoice)
    print(pool)

What code?
Do you have a URL? Or a link of some kind?

You are correct on all counts.
Every time you run the program it is reinitialised
to the hard coded values.

To make the changes stick you would need to store
them somewhere and then read them@startup.
There are many ways to do that, some work better
than others with dictionaries: the shelve module
or the CSV module or the JSON module are all fairly
easy to use.

However, I suspect the book's author is only looking
for you to play the game once and then forget the
values (or start afresh) She/he will likely cover
files later.

To that end you need to look@wrapping your menu
selection in a loop (probably a while) and keep on
applying the changes until you are done.

Sorry, there's nothing there ("my code"), attachments don't usually make
it through the list server.

You may want to send again, but you may also want to look into groups
with more domain expertise - the kind of image processing used for
facial recognition is pretty specialized and I'm not expecting you'll
find a lot of experts here.  Are you using OpenCV?  There it is expected
that most of the work is "done for you", but you still need to
understand what is going on in order to be able to proceed.

I never understood why this is syntactically correct. It's like two parentheses are missing.

This I understand:
all((c.isdigit() for c in '12c4'))
Or this:
all([c.isdigit() for c in '12c4'])
Or this:
all((True, False))

But the way you wrote it, the generator expression just "floats" in between the parentheses that are part of the all() function. Is this something special about all() and any()?

No, it is something special about generator expressions. The syntax for 
them is theoretically:

    expression for x in iterable

but parentheses are required to make it unambiguous. If they are already 
inside parentheses, as in a function call:

   spam(expression for x in iterable)

the function call parens are sufficient to make it unambiguous and so 
there is no need to add an extra pair.

However, if you have two arguments, or some other compound expression, 
you need to use disambiguation parens:

    spam(999, (expression for x in iterable))

I know I don't have to apologize, but I am so independent I hate asking for
help and you guys and gals have been so helpful that now that I'm stuck
again I'm sorry I have to. I've looked on StackOverflow and followed their
advice (which I can't make work) and went to the python/turtle
documentation which I tried to follow, but can't seem to make work either.

All I want to do (famous last words) is randomize the color of the pen when
the ciphers are created, but when the ciphers are created, the color
remains black. The comments below colormode are things I've tried as well.
I include all the code in case you want to run the program.

So if you could please help like you do, that would be great and greatly
appreciated. Thank you.

Any expression can be used where a value is expected provided
that e3xpression produces a value of the required type.

A generator expression effectively produces a sequence and
the type of sequence is defined by the type of parentheses
used.

"123" -> a string
[1,2,3] -> a list
(1,2,3) -> a tuple
{1,2,3} -> a set

So when a function requires an iterable sequence you just
provide the expression(any expression) that results in an
iterable.

all(range(5))  # range 5 produces a range object which is iterable
all(n for n in [0,1,2,3,4])  # generator "equivalent" to the range

Similar things happen with tuples where the parens are actually
optional:

1,2,3   # a tuple of 3 numbers
(1,2,3) # the same tuple with parens to make it more obvious

Thats not a problem and, in programming, is usually seen as
a strength not a weakness. Nobody likes to debug somebody
else's bad code, it's much better to get advice and write
good code first time! Independence is the fault, not
collaboration.

You do seem to have a liking for writing an awful lot of unnecessary
code. Have you come across the concept of functions? They allow you
to take common code and encapsulate it in a single call.
Thus:

>     pu()
>     goto(0, 65)
>     seth(90)
>     pd()
>     fd(35)

Becomes

def f(y):
    pu()
    goto(0, y)
    seth(90)
    pd()
    fd(35)

if digits[-1] == "1":
   f(100)
if digits[-1] == "2":
   f(65)

And ideally you use a more meaningful name than 'f'!
Maybe reposition() or similar?

The principle is known as DRY in software engineering:
- Don't Repeat Yourself

Also we already (I think it was for you) pointed
out that using an int() conversion with try/except was
easier and more reliable that a regex.
Its also much less code. So unless you really enjoy
practising your typing, it's easier to do something like:

d = input("Enter an integer less than 10,000 greater than 0:  ")
try: int(d)
except: # they are not digits so deal with it

# now use d knowing it is all digits.

You set these values once. And never change them.

> ##bluish = random.randrange(255)

You don't draw anything so how do you know what colour is set?
You have to draw a line to see the color.

> # pencolor(random.randrange(255), random.randrange(255),
> random.randrange(255))
> pencolor(r, g, b)

Same goes for these.

> mode("logo")   # resets turtle heading to north

Now you draw something, what color is it?
(although you might need a pd() to force the pen on to the canvas)

> # if statements for the ones position
> if digits[-1] == "1":

See the comments about functions above...
And only do the extraction once:

last = d[-1]
if last == "1":
   f(...)
elif last == "2):
   f(...)
elif last = "3"
etc...

> if digits[-1] == "3":
>     pu()
>     goto(0, 100)
>     seth(135)

I see a new value in the last line so maybe f becomes

def f(y,d):
     pu()
     goto(0, y)
     seth(135)
     pd()
     fd(d)

It still saves a heck of a lot of typing!

> if digits[-1] == "5":

>     rt(135)
>     fd(50)

And here you add two lines so either just tag the two
lines after f or define a new function:

def g(y,d,angle,d2):
   f(y,d)
   rt(angle)
   fd(d2)

I strongly suspect we can simplify this a lot more
but that should be a start.

But as to the colors, you only draw one line and you
only set the color once so it's hard to see how
randomising anything is going to be useful.

Message-ID: <CABdYP63q4Z_pUD9P2VeSmCB2jcYRigYJ17Ka6n4zHeCQuWaFUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I need to create an executable file from py2app utility

with the help of documentation on python.org i am able to create executable
file on MAC OS X

my question is the sample.app created with the help of py2app utility and i
go inside the sample.app/resources i can still fine the python source file
( sample.py)

if we are creating the executable why there is inclusion of .py file in
final bundle as we are not suppose to share the source code

can you help me how can i remove sample.py in the final bundle creation
from py2app utility

You wll have to ask the py2app developers why they include the source 
code. Usually, the answer to that question is so that they can show 
debugging information in the tracebacks if an exception occurs.

Perhaps there is an option to py2app that removes the .py files and only 
includes .pyc files. What does the documentation say?

Hi,
I was reading through the secrets documentation in Python 3.6 and noticed that it uses /dev/urandom?but I'm unsure if that means it'll use a hardware RNG or just one provided by the operating system (Linux / Windows / etc) in software. The question is is it possible to determine the source of the randomness from os.urandom?if there was ever a flaw found in a particular hardware RNG? Plus systems could have a third party hardware RNG that was an external addon card or similar which might be better than the one found in Intel CPUs.
I'm just a bit curious about the whole "will always use the strongest source for pseudo-random numbers" when research could change that assumption overnight based on discovered flaws.
This is probably a really stupid question and if it is I apologise but I'm somewhat confused.
Thanks for any help.

Getting cryptographic-quality random numbers right is very hard, and 
that's not something which the Python core developers have either the 
experience or desire to do. So the secrets module is an interface to the 
operating system's source of randomness.

If your operating system uses a hardware RNG for /dev/urandom (or the 
equivalent for Windows), then so will the secrets module. If it doesn't, 
then neither will secrets.

In other words, Python trusts the operating system. Generally speaking, 
most people should too. Most major operating systems, including Windows, 
Linux, OS X, and various Unixes have well-respected RNGs which are 
generally considered secure.

But of course there's a lot we don't know about the state of the art of 
*secret* crypto research and the capabilities of major government 
intelligence agencies. What little we do know, we can thank a handful of 
people like Edward Snowden and a few other unnamed whistle-blowers who 
have leaked NSA documents.

And flaws could be discovered@any time. Naturally, if a flaw is 
discovered, the secrets module cannot magically patch it or replace the 
software with something else. That's up to the operating system.


> The question is is it possible to 
> determine the source of the randomness from os.urandom?if there was 
> ever a flaw found in a particular hardware RNG?

You have to ask your OS developers about that, but the secrets module 
doesn't support anything like that. It can't peer inside the OS and 
determine how os.urandom works.

Certainly you are right to be cautious about hardware RNGs. Back in 2013 
it has become clear that the NSA@least (if not other intelligence 
agencies) have compromised or inserted backdoors into many if not all 
hardware-based RNGs in common use:

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?pagewanted=all


So if you are using a commercially available hardware RNG, you should 
assume that the Five Eyes countries (the USA, UK, Australia, Canada and 
New Zealand) have compromised it.

In the case of Linux,@least, /dev/urandom will use the output of the 
hardware RNG, but it is mixed in with other sources of cryptographically 
strong randomness and is believed to be safe.

The full quote is:

"The secrets module provides access to the most secure source of 
randomness THAT YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM PROVIDES." [emphasis added]

https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html

So don't imagine that the secrets module has access to the cutting edge 
classified crypto technology used by the NSA :-)

If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask on the mailing 
list, and I will do my best to answer.

By the way, I am the author of the secrets module:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0506/

If you haven't already read the PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal), you 
should, it contains a lot of background for why the secrets module was 
invented.

No need to apologise! Hope I cleared up your confusion, and if not, 
please feel free to ask anything else that concerns you.

A quick look shows you are using print statements and print functions.  So,
are you using python 3 or python 2?  What exactly are you asking about?

That last line makes no sense. Its a boolean expression using an
undeclared variable(loop) You should get a name error when you run
it.

Again you reference loop but you have not assigned any
value to it. You should get an error here too.

This is the end of your while loop and you have not modified
the test condition (loop) so even if loop existed this would
just loop forever. One of the fundamental principles of while
loops is that you must either modify the test condition
somehow or use a break somewhere inside the loop.

Also using input to convert your data is a bad design. ijput is very
insecure and users could (deliberately or by accident) type values which
python then executes and cause damagew, in extreme cases even crashing
your computer. Its much better to explicitly convert the raw_input string:

     choice = int(raw_input("Enter your choice [1-4]: "))

To catch invalid input wrap it in a try/except block...


> if choice==1:"Menu login 1"
> 	count = 0

This doesn't work either. You have an if test where the
body is the single line containing the string. It doesn't
do anything  although it is legal Python but...
The next line is indented as if it were part of the if
block but it isn't so you should get an error there too.

Now you have a loop that will go forever continually defining
(but not calling) a function.

Inside the function you might want to check the getpass
function from the getpass module for a more secure password
input. If you are on Unix/Linux/MacOS you could also look
at the pwd module for ways of validating the user.

Fiunally note that the if coice === 3 line is inside
the invalid user block so would only be executed if it
was an invalid user - which seems wrong?

In fact I'd suggest that if block should not even be
inside the User() function@all. Its not really checking
anything about the user, its checking what the user did.
Try to keep your functions purpose clear and distinct,
don't mix functionality in a single function.

> for val in "string":
>     if val == "i":

This assigns val to s,then t then r then i so it will allways break on
the 4th cycle.

You might as well just write

for val in 'str':

>     print(val)

And since you just print val you might as well miss out the loop and use

print('s\nt\nr\n')

> print("The end")
>        
>    if choice==2:     
>        print " Menu create an account 2"

This is indented but there is no enclosing block so
should give an indentation error.

Note the indentation is all over the place.
Python is fussy about consistent indentation, you will get errors here.

Also you reference c but c does not appear anywhere else.
What is c?

The remaining code has more of the same so I'll stop here.
I think you need to strip this back and get the basic structure working
first before trying to add all the other functions.

print a menu, read the input and print the users choice.
Exit when option 4 is used.

Get that working then you can add the code to process
the choices one by one. Get each choice working before
adding the next.

Generally we like to know what you think is wrong with it. For example, what 
you expected it to do, and a little transcript of what it actually did 
(cut/paste the text from your terminal/console straight in this email, complete 
with any stack traces that came with it, if there were any).

This looks like homework, and we're generally happy to help if you'll explain 
what you're trying to achieve and show the code you have so far. I'm glad to 
see you've included all your code here, it is usually necessary.

Absent an actual error transcript I can make a few general remarks about the 
code which might lead you towards making it work the way you intend it to.

Remarks inline below, in the code:

The line above "loop!=4" is a simple expression. It is valid, but useless.  
Normally a test with be part of a statement, such as the condition in an "if" 
or "while".

Also, because it is indented it is inside the "print_menu" function,
which doesn't seem very relevant - the function shouldn't care about
the value of "loop".

>while loop:          ## While loop which will keep going until loop = False

You haven't set a value to "loop" yet, so this code will raise an exception as 
soon as you try to test "loop". Probably it should be set to True before the 
loop begins.

>    choice = input("Enter your choice [1-4]: ")
>

>	count = 0

Indentation is important in Python. Because this "if" statement is not 
indented, it is outside the "while" loop above. It looks like you while loop is 
meant to offer menu choices until the user chooses "Quit". So all the code 
acting on those choices needs to be inside the loop, and thus indents the same 
as the 2 lines above it which print the menu and read the choice.

You're setting "count = 0" but I don't see you use "count" elsewhere.

This probably doesn't do what you imagine. A "def" statement is a statement, to 
be run. This loop runs forever, but all it does in the loop is _define_ the 
function "User". It never calls the function. So it will just run forever, 
redefining the function again and again.

Probably you need to define the function _before_ the loop, and actually call 
the function inside the loop.

Normally all your function definitions will be outside the main code, so the 
"User" function definition should be above this, for example right underneath 
your "print_menu" function definition. Likewise your other functions.

>for val in "string":
>    if val == "i":
>        break
>    print(val)

I presume this is just a little exercise loop to print some of the leading 
characters from the string "string".

>print("The end")
>
>   if choice==2:
>       print " Menu create an account 2"

This "if" statement _is_ indented correctly for the main loop you set up 
earlier, but all the intervening code will be getting in the way. Once you have 
all the function definitions up the top of your code things will work better.
>
>def main():
>    register()

Note that this just defines a "main" function. Nothing seems to call it.

>def register():
>    username = input("Please input your desired username ")
>    password = input("Please input your desired password ")
>     if not username or not password:

This "if" is indented differently to the other statements in this function. It 
needs to move left one space.

You seem to be using Python 2. In Python 2, input() actually evaluates the 
input string as a Python expression. This is why you got an integer earlier 
when you prompted the user for "choice". However, when reading strings such as 
usernames or passwords you need to use raw_input(), not input(). raw_input() 
just reads the string and returns it.

>            print "Enter a valid username and password..."

Here's you are admonishing the user for entering an empty username or password.  
However you don't then do anything about it; instead your code falls through 
and starts setting up the user.

You probably want a loop shapes more like this (totally untested):

    while True:
        username = input("Please input your desired username ")
        if len(username) == 0:
            print("Empty username rejected.")
            continue
        password = input("Please input your desired password ")
        if len(password) == 0:
            print("Empty password rejected.")
            continue
        break

which will keep prompting until both the username and password are acceptable.  
_Then_ it breaks out of the loop and proceeds.

>        userList = users['list_users_response']['list_users_result']['users']
>        if username in userList:
>            print "username already exist"
>            else:

This "else" needs to be indented the same as the "if".

It seems odd to call the "login" function after creating the user.

>
> if choice==3:

Again, this "if" should be indented for the main loop like the other "choice" 
"if" statements.

> def login():
>    check = open("credential.txt","r")

Here you're opening the credential.txt file, but not doing anything with it.

>    username = input("Please enter your username")
>    password = input("Please enter your password")

Again, these lines should call raw_input(), not input().

> def thank_you():
>  print("Thank you for signing up@our website!.")

You define this function but never call it.

>    elif choice == "q":
>    exit()

The call to exit() needs to be indented in order to be inside the "elif".

Also, exit() is not a builtin function. I need to import it. Normally you would 
put this import@the very top of your program, such as:

  from sys import exit

I also notice here that you're expecting the user to be able to enter a "q" 
instead of a "4". So this doesn't match your menu.  But if you do want the user 
to enter a "q" the you need to use raw_input() instead of input() in your menu 
prompt, and your other "choice" values need to be strings, such as "1", "2" and 
so forth.

I have to assume that you are very new to python. Have you written a Python
program that runs the way you want it to?

It is often useful to start by writing a very simple program that contains
one aspect of the problem you're trying to solve, then getting that program
to run. Then you add another feature and get that to run.

When you run into a problem, then email us the code, and tell us what
version of python you're using, what you did to run the program, what
results you expected, and what results you got. You can often handle the
latter by copying and pasting the execution. If the result was a traceback
be sure to include the entire traceback.

Subject: [Tutor] prime factorisation
Message-ID: <5aa549d3.6291df0a.49cca.ffd4@mx.google.com>

Dear python tutors,

for training purposes, I am writing a Python program for prime factorisation.

Functions for reading in the number and finding the primes are working alright (of Course, finding primes up to ? Number would suffice).

Still, the function for finding the factorization itsel does not work. I am not sure, but the number i running through the primes for checking does not seem to work properly.

Would you please be so kind as to help?

Thank you very much.

Best wishes,

Bernd

It was my understanding that using a virtual environment kept everything 
isolated in that environment. So I was surprised when I got the 
following error message.

(env) jfb@jims-mint18 ~ $

File 
"/home/jfb/EVs/env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/selenium/webdriver/remote/remote_connection.py",

   File "/usr/lib/python3.5/urllib/request.py", line 466, in open

<snip>

I snipped most of the error msg because for the purpose of this question 
I am not interested in them. I tried  something that I did not think 
would work and it did not.

I am wondering why the path for the first line and every line above it 
is /home/jfb/EVs/env and the second line and everything after is is
/usr/lib/.

I didn't think anything from my system python would be involved if I 
started from a virtual environment.

I installed pyvenv in Jan 17 using synaptic on  Mint 18.

Here are the contents of the pyvenv cfg file:

home = /usr/bin
include-system-site-packages = false
version = 3.5.2

It's been awhile so I don't remember that much about the installation. I 
really don't know that much about virtual environments so I am guessing 
I accepted the defaults for the installation.

Just to be complete here is the entire error msg:

It is possible to make a virtualenv which references the osurce python's 
library. These days the default is isolation, but older virtualenvs used to 
hook to the original python by default. This is controlled by virtualenv's 
--system-site-packages and --no-site-packages. Maybe you should build the env 
again using --no-site-packages explicitly and see if the behaviour changes.

If you're not using the "virtualenv" command to make the environment, please 
tell use exactly how it was made (there are other tools for the same purpose).

In fact, tell us regardless. It aids debugging.

I?m working with two dataframes obtained from the infrared spectroscopy

At this point, they are both (after a LOT of work) converted into a pandas
dataframe but, as a final result, I?d like to create one big dataframe
because those two are related by the variables s1, s2, s3, s4 and so on.
So, I?d like to insert the variables s1, s2, s3, sn every time they appear
in the DATA1:

***DATA1 with DATA2:***
*(I tried to use ** to show you every time DATA 2 was inserted into DATA1)*

        IR    RAMAN   CM-1
     245.54  730.41  3538.10   *s1* 100 ***STRE   14   21   NH    1.015055*

       3.44  136.83  3229.53   *s3* -78 ***STRE    1   22   CH    1.081994***
*s5* 15  ***STRE   19   26   CH 1.080387***

Observe that some lines can have more than two variables.
I have to admit that I?m completely lost using pandas right now and any
help is much appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

This is normal. Virtual environments are not isolated from the standard library.

Hello Bernd,

My comments below, interleaved with yours.

Actually you only need to go up to square root of the number.

What do you mean, does not work? In what way?

When you run the code, what does it do?

That code doesn't actually do what you think it does. In fact, it is an 
accident that it works@all!

The problem is the line

    except ValueError or num < 1

which does *not* catch a ValueError and check that num is less than one. 
Instead, it evaluates to just catching ValueError. So it never checks 
that the entered number is positive.



Regards,



Steve

I think You would do much better if You wrote pseudo code first,
i.e. write each step out in words,
code is much easier to write following pseudo code

Are You trying to factor Prime Numbers?
Prime Number factored (Prime Number and 1)

Interesting. All I know about virtual environments is what I read on the 
net. I always see them recommended as a way to keep from messing up the 
default python, so I thought isolation was their purpose.

You're thinking of isolating packages that are installed in
site-packages, not the standard library. There's no point in copying
and recompiling the entire standard library in every virtual
environment.

you are talking about different sides of isolation. you install into a virtualenv and those pkgs don't go into the system area. that says nothing about using existing bits of the system...

Just curious. So do they share parts of the standard libray? What 
happens if the version of python I have in a virtual environment is 
totally different than any python available from the os? Say version 3 
vs version 2 in the os.

Just curious. So do they share parts of the standard libray? What
happens if the version of python I have in a virtual environment is
totally different than any python available from the os? Say version 3
vs version 2 in the os.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I'm a beginner in Python. I have written a code to open browsers using
selenium framework. I have purchased a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with
CentOS 6.9 installed from GoDaddy.

My code is working well in localhost but when I try to open that in VPS
server I'm failing in running that code. I'm getting errors. I have
installed Chrome and it's drivers. Even though I'm facing errors.

I request your team to help me in this. Please find the attachments

Hi,
   I am new to python. I am trying to test my program, like a coursera
submission, which takes run time arguments using "raw_input()". Is there a
way I can write all the input data into a file and pass it from command
line to the script?
1. I have to use "raw_input".
2. I do not wish to open a file inside the script as that will beat the
purpose.

Thanks for any and all the help.

Thanks,

Welcome,

Your attachments did not come through.  This list generally only works with in-line text.  If you post your code, what you expect and what the errors are, we will have a better chance of helping.

Being a tutor list, help with the selenium framework is not guaranteed, though.  Hopefully your issue is something basic.

This is a text based email list so any binary attachments get stripped
by the server for security reasons. Please send the code plus any error
messages as text within your emails. Alternatively post images on a web
site and send a link.

In normal Python yes, you can simply pass the file name as an
argument to the program or you can use input redirection to
read the data from the file as if it were input by a user.

Unfortunately neither of these options is likely to work in
a web environment - one of the disadvantages of using such
a tool. The issue is not a Python one but one with your
tutorial. I suggest you contact the authors directly to
ask if they can suggest a solution (or incorporate
such a feature).

In real-world python you could just use input redirection:

########## data.txt ##########
Alan
##############################

########## myscript.py #######
name = raw_input("What's your name? ")
print "Hello ", name
##############################

Executed with:

$ python myscript.py < data.txt

If you are using Linux or other UNIX like system (such as a Mac) the 
'HERE Document' feature [1] of the OS might prove useful:

# File: dummy.py
inputs = {}
inputs["first"] = raw_input("")
inputs["second"] = raw_input("")
for key in inputs.keys():
     print inputs[key]

Then from the command line:
alex@x301n4:~$ python dummy.py << HERE
first input
second input
HERE

On my system[2] the result is:
second input
first input

Better than what?

The standard mechanisms work fine (mysql documentation has a decent writeup)

Sorry, I misread your question, somehow my eyes saw mysql instead of
mssql.  Will leave that to others to answer, don't use SQL Server.

As Mats said, better than what?
There are@least two "official" ways:
1) using the SQL Server driver
2) Using the ODBC driver.

Both are described here:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server

If you are doing anything else then try these.
If they don't work get back to us with more specific
details.
